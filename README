Two simple Processing scripts to convert .mcm files to .png and vice versa.
Run mcm_to_png to generate a .png file from your .mcm file, edit it in your favorite editor and then run png_to_mcm to create your new .mcm file.

Use this in any way you like.

WHEN USING THE NEW .MCM FILE FOR AN OSD, PLEASE CHECK IF EVERYTHING WORKS AS EXPECTED BEFORE TAKEOFF!
